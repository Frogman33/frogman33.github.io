I play games:
<br>I play games because I want to focus on a task and finish it.

<br>I believe games should be played casually until the game is finished, nothing more.

<br>If it is not, I don't consider it "playing" the game.

<br>If it is not, That game is a tool to prove something.

<br>If it is not, That game is a tool that says, "See, look at me I am better than that person."


<br>We can see this example in games like League of Legends, Dota 2, and Esports games.


<br>I consider esports a competition, not a game that you enjoy when you play and finish. There is no finish  in esports; it is ongoing. and you can see that most competitors are under a lot of stress from sitting all day in an extremely toxic community. If you play team games like League of Legends or Dota 2, there is an extremely cringe culture going on that expects people in your team to do what you want; if not, you will get blamed, bullied, or banned for "ruining the game".


<br>I personally don't play those games anymore. Yes, there are times when I have fun playing those games. The community is also toxic and cringe. I can just ignore it, but no, it is too much. There is also no endgame. Is Rank 1 the endgame? What about next season's rank 1? It has no endgame; it is ongoing.


<br>My understanding of why people play those games is social acceptance. The cool kid gate is there. Go get a high rank, and you will get in.


<br>Yes, it is cool if you are good at something, especially something actually important. Most of these games are team-based. How can you make a system that accurately shows how good a person is?


<br>Is a win in one game that you randomly match with another four people can tell that a person is good at the game? I don't think so.

<br>The game took 30-40 minutes to play. and the system does not even acculate. People can just be reasonably good, play a lot of games, and get the highest rank. And most people I see who play a lot of games don't even have fun.


<br>People use the game as a tool to prove something rather than enjoy it.

<br>It is true that I also get joy from beating other people. But playing games and enjoying them are different.

I play World of Warcraft Vanilla private server.

<br>Endgame is Level 60 (the game is finished). I play alone. I play for fun and nothing more.

<br>Why I define level 60 as the endgame Leveling from 1 to 60 took a long time to play. Also, to make


<br>The way to level is to gain experience, which you get by killing monsters, exploring new zones, and questing. Genuinely, the best way to level to 60 is to quest.


<br>WoW is a progressive game. you play by the rules, you get something.



<br>
<br>No grouping


<br>Grouping in this context means content that requires you to group, like dungeons, raids, and group quests.


<br>I only group with random people when doing a normal quest if there is a high population in the zone.

<br>It took a long time, and what's important is that you have focus while you're doing those things. That means you can't switch tasks or pause the game and do something else in real life. I see grouping content as a very dangerous activity because it requires you to be on screen and focus for a long time, and you can get into the thought that you do it for others, so it is a good thing, which I believe leads to devaluing anything that happens in your life.


<br>I also think that grouping rewards is not fair. The way that you get gear when grouping is that when an item drops, you can accept to roll, which is a random chance to get the gear. It creates a weird interaction of unfairness.


<br>So If you grouping or do group contents, that means your gears are a group effort instead of your own effort. One of the reasons that I play this game is the sense of progression. Progress that I create on my own.

<br>
<br>No cheating
<br>The private server that I chose has to have a good population and be unlikely to cheat.

<br>People get banned when buying gold.

<br>People who run the server get exposed for spawning characters and selling them. lead to players quitting the server.

<br>You're supposed to get punished when you cheat.
<br>

<br>A big change always ruins the game.


<br>I am a fan of creativity, but not in this game. This is a progressive game; it should stay static. It should stay the same by keeping it standard. When the standard changes and the ground changes, the whole thing is not the same. and that is very important when you play this game. When you play WoW Vanilla, you keep playing it because you can feel the static of the game. What I do is my progress. If something changes the way to obtain that progress, the progress is no longer static; the value changes.



<br>And that is how this game changed in the newer versions.


<br>Higher damage, Higher experience drop, and so on. In the short term, it seems to make players happy.


<br>but it keeps going to the point that leveling is not the endgame; it is something else that requires more people to achieve a virtual goal.


<br>This creates the feeling that the game gets easier as time goes by. The progress that players used to make is becoming more worthless as time goes by. If you want to progress in WoW, you have to always play the current version.



<br>I don't think this game should be owned by a corporation. Paying $15 a month to work in a game is kind of funny. More funny is that they don't even care about people cheating.
